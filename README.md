#JavaScript and Data Structure - Part 1 ( Stack ) 

Implementing different Data Structure in JavaScript

In this first part , I'm going to implement STACK  Data Structure. STACK follows LIFO principle. ( LAST IN FIRST OUT ). 
Methods / Features available in a STACK Data Strucutre are the following 

1.) Add Elements to Top of Stack
2.) Remove Elements from Top
3.) Check last element value or value of the top of the STACK
4.) Length of STACK
5.) Check whether STACK is empty or not
6.) clear all elements of stack
7.) print all the elements in the stack

Using JavaScript, I'm going to implement all the above methods in a function and that function can be used a STACK equivalent. We can use the STACK fucntion as a function constrcutor, then we can create new objects or we can create instances which will behave as a STACK.
